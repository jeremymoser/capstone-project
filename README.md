## Website and Secure Portal for Small's Community College (Group #1)

The team developed and deployed a front-end website and secure portal with role-based privileges driven by a MySQL database to address the Smallâ€™s Community College project.

PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor was the scripting language of choice coupled with a MySQL (Maria DB) database hosted on a virtual private web server (VPS).

The web application is designed and developed with an adapted model-view-controller (MVC) design pattern. Additionally, the use of Bootstrap allows for mobile access to both the website and the secure portal. Some pages with large tables are best viewed on a large screen. The website and secure portal automatically adjust to the color mode selected within select operating systems, displaying light and dark color modes, respectively.

Access to the database is performed through a PHP Data Object (PDO) connection. PDO is a lightweight, consistent framework for securely accessing data with PHP. All insert and update statements are prepared statements with bound parameters. All data retrieval and modification are completed through views or stored procedures.
